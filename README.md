# hello-world
This repository is for practicing coding 
My name is Aileen Doan, I am a 25 year old born and raised Louisville Kentuckian but still very in tuned with my asian american culture. I'd like to say I am an extrovert, I enjoy socialing with people and gaining different perspectives. My favorite thing is to laugh and make other people laugh. I'm hoping this program will help me with this rapidly growing technilogical world.
